# Instagram Story Downloader by Micha Birklbauer

A python script to download Instagram stories via the website [storiesig.com](https://storiesig.com).

## Usage

- Without arguments: Asks for your input for a username!
- With one argument: Assumes that it is a username and downloads from that username!
- With two arguments:
  - First: Username/User ID
  - Second: True/False (if it is a user ID or not)
- More arguments: Prints usage options!

## Credits

Even though the stories are hosted by Instagram directly, I scrap the website [storiesig.com](https://storiesig.com) to retrieve their locations!
